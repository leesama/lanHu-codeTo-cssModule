## Project Introduction

Lanhu-Code-To-CssModule is a Tampermonkey plugin designed to intercept code copied by users from Lanhu design drafts and reassemble it into the CSS Module format. With this plugin, you can transform the style code from Lanhu design drafts into a more suitable modularized format for frontend projects, thus accelerating the style application process.

## Plugin Features

- **Convert Page Code to CSS Module Format:** When you copy page code on a Lanhu code page, the plugin will automatically convert it to the CSS Module format.

- **Convert Style Code to CSS Module Format:** Similarly, when you copy style code on a Lanhu code page, it will be transformed into a format compatible with CSS Modules.

## Usage Instructions

1. Ensure that Tampermonkey or another browser extension that supports user scripts is installed.

2. Download and install this Tampermonkey plugin.

3. Open your Lanhu design draft page.

4. First, select and copy the page code you want to apply. Then, paste the copied page code into your frontend project.

5. Next, select and copy the style code. Paste the copied style code into your frontend project as well.

## Notes

Please note that you must copy the page code before copying the style code.
